# eGEBEYA - An Online Marketplace

This GitHub repository houses the codebase for eGEBEYA, a revolutionary marketplace developed as our culminating project for graduation from the School of Commerce at Addis Ababa University.

## NB

This website is totally ideal and it is not an operating company(At least now). The contents in the introduction part of
this README have some ideal issues.

## Introduction

eGEBEYA aims to solve the problem of providing a user-friendly and efficient online marketplace for individuals and
businesses to buy and sell various products and services. The platform includes features such as user authentication,
product listings, shopping cart functionality, payment integration, a review and rating system, and messaging
capabilities.(Currently not all the features are integrated.)

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and a web framework Flask for the back-end. The platform uses SQLite database. The users data and the products data are stored in the database.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can create accounts and log in.(Used flask form and Flask login library to implement)
- Product listings: Buyers can see what products are available on the platform.
- Users can buy the product they want from the platform.
- Responsive design: The platform is optimized for desktop and mobile screens using CSS flex box and media query. (Still
  not used any CSS Framework).
- Users can edit their profiles information
- Users can change their password

## Technologies used

- Programming Languages: HTML and CSS(for the frontend), Python(With flask frame work)
- Front-end Framework: CSS Only: with media query and flexbox to make it responsive
- Back-end Framework: Flask
- Database: It's using SQLite3 for database. The database file stored locally...cuz I don't have any server to use for
  that.

## Usage

Once they open the website, users can perform the following actions:

- Create an account or log in with existing credentials.
- Browse product listings and search for specific items.(Searching is not implemented.)
- Select and click the Purchase button to buy the product they want or see more details about the product by clicking more info.
## NB

This project is underdevelopment. You can download the repo. Create a python3 virtual environement install the
requirements in the env and run the run.py file.
